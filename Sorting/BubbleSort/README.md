## Sorting: Bubble Sort

Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm. Once sorted, print the following three lines:

- Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where  is the number of swaps that took place.
- First Element: firstElement, where  is the first element in the sorted array.
- Last Element: lastElement, where  is the last element in the sorted array.

### Example
arr =  [6,4,1]

Output is:
Array is sorted in 3 swaps.  
First Element: 1  
Last Element: 6  

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer, n, the size of the array a.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers a[i].
